# Deployment Qualification

> AI documentation reminder: when behavior in this area changes, update the related ADRs, architecture docs, context packs, and README files in the same change.

- Status: active qualification procedure
- Supporting plan: [Deployment Readiness Implementation Roadmap](../deployment-readiness-implementation-roadmap.md)
- Operations: [Persistence Operations](persistence-operations.md)

"Implemented" means the repository contains the active composition, configuration,
tests, and operator surface. "Production-qualified" additionally requires evidence
from the actual operating system, PostgreSQL service, artifact service, network,
identity boundary, and backup platform. Repository unit tests cannot substitute
for those controlled-environment results.

## Repository gates

Run from a clean dependency install using the supported Node LTS line:

```text
npm run docs:check
npm run architecture:check
npm run agent-support:check
npm run asset-system:check
npm run deployment:check
npm test
npm run build:server
npm run build:thin-client
npm run package
```

Asset/system profiles and evidence truth rules are defined in
[Asset and System Support Qualification](asset-system-support-qualification.md).
Repository gates do not satisfy its controlled recovery, performance, security,
accessibility, or cross-platform checks by themselves.

CI additionally builds and scans the image, boots the isolated Compose stack,
smokes both probes, and renders the checked-in Kubernetes Kustomize composition
without contacting a cluster. The equivalent local container gate is:

```text
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<qualification-only> \
docker compose -f deployments/server/compose.qualification.yaml up --build --detach --wait --wait-timeout 240
npm run deployment:smoke
docker compose -f deployments/server/compose.qualification.yaml down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

Node.js recommends production use of Active or Maintenance LTS releases; the
server image currently pins Node 24 LTS. See the official
[Node.js release table](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

## Live PostgreSQL qualification

Point `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` at an isolated disposable database and run:

```text
npm run test:postgres-live
```

Repository CI runs this command against a health-checked PostgreSQL 18 service
on a private runner network. It proves adapter conformance and concurrent
migration startup on every change; it does not replace TLS, capacity, backup, or
platform qualification against the target managed service.

The same CI job then runs `npm run test:postgres-recovery`. It takes a
custom-format logical backup, destroys and recreates the disposable database,
restores it, and retains sanitized count, digest, backup checksum, and recovery
timing evidence for 14 days. A passing logical drill proves the repository's
backup/restore procedure is executable; it does not qualify managed PITR,
cross-region recovery, target RPO/RTO, or coordinated artifact restoration.

Then qualify managed startup with `NODE_ENV=production`, the selected
`DEPLOYMENT_SHAPE`, `oidc-bearer`, exact IdP configuration, real TLS material,
an RLS-safe runtime database role, provisioned memberships, and the same database.
Verify `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, a representative thin-client workflow,
multi-pool collection contention without lost updates, same-record revision
conflicts, pool timeout/recovery, graceful SIGTERM drain, JSON
import retry/divergence behavior, portable export, pooled cross-organization
denial, dedicated-placement rejection, transaction-local context clearing,
physical object-prefix separation, redacted audit output, and database plus
artifact restore. The live test must never target a production database.

For the isolated Compose profile, inject unique qualification-only secrets and
run `docker compose -f deployments/server/compose.qualification.yaml up --build`.
The profile intentionally uses unencrypted PostgreSQL only inside its private
network; this does not qualify a production TLS connection.

## Kubernetes or managed platform qualification

Repository CI runs `kubectl kustomize deployments/server` to parse and compose
both reviewed example manifests without API discovery. This local render proves
YAML and KRM composition only; it does not replace server-side validation
against the target cluster version and admission policy.

Render `deployments/server/kubernetes-deployment.example.yaml` through the owning
platform's configuration system, replace the image placeholder with an immutable
digest, and validate server-side before rollout. The manifest deliberately keeps
liveness independent of PostgreSQL while readiness includes PostgreSQL and
artifact storage, so a dependency outage removes traffic without creating a
restart storm.

Render `deployments/server/kubernetes-runner.example.yaml` separately in an
isolated qualification namespace. Keep the specimen job suspended; have the
deployment controller create a fresh immutable job from a reviewed equivalent.
Verify Restricted Pod Security admission, default-deny ingress and egress,
namespace and per-container CPU/memory/ephemeral-storage limits, opaque tenant
labels, secret-reference injection, active deadline, cancellation pre-stop,
termination grace, and distinct startup/readiness/liveness behavior. Add only
the DNS and destination-specific egress rules required by an admitted run. The
template does not select or certify a container/WASI sandbox, and imported or
authored execution must remain `sandbox-unavailable` until the injected adapter
has separate escape, isolation, resource, and cancellation qualification.

Until multi-replica tenancy, capacity, and target-platform qualification pass, the
template enforces one replica with a `Recreate` strategy so a nominal
single-replica upgrade cannot overlap old and new Pods. It also requires
non-root execution, runtime-default seccomp, no privilege escalation, no Linux
capabilities, a read-only root filesystem, no service-account token, bounded
temporary storage, and explicit resource requests/limits.

Run a canary first. Confirm migration serialization, OIDC key rotation,
organization membership, pooled or dedicated placement, readiness,
secret/certificate rotation, volume permissions, storage capacity alerting,
termination within the grace period, and rollback compatibility. Do not increase
replicas until shared repository concurrency, RLS-safe roles, tenant isolation,
object storage, and audit behavior are qualified for that deployment.

## Release evidence record

For each shape, retain the source revision and image/package digest, OS/runtime and
database versions, configuration profile name (without secret values), command
results, backup identifiers, restore timings, data/export counts and hashes,
security scan references, known exceptions, approver, and timestamp. A failed,
skipped, or unavailable environment check remains visible; it must not be rewritten
as a pass.
