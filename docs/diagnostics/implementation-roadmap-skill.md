# Implementation roadmap skill

The canonical cross-agent workflow is
`skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps/SKILL.md`. It prepares, approves,
executes, reviews, and resumes substantial implementation roadmaps as ordered
increments. It also maintains repository-based progress so work can be reviewed
or resumed without depending on one AI task's conversation state.

## Automatic routing

Agents must route to the skill by intent, not only by exact name. Use it when a
user:

- asks for an implementation roadmap;
- asks to implement, continue, review, or resume roadmap increments;
- asks to use a skill if one is available for roadmap work;
- requests durable progress tracking for a substantial multi-increment change.

For example, this is a complete invocation:

> Please use a skill if available to create an implementation roadmap for this
> feature. Please follow the guidance in AGENTS.md and docs/README.md.

The user does not need to remember `manage-implementation-roadmaps`. The
natural-language trigger does not waive the skill's approval checkpoints.

## Approval and execution model

The workflow requires:

1. repository and primary-source discovery;
2. two or three options for each high-level choice with one recommendation;
3. explicit user approval of the selected high-level option;
4. an ordered increment roadmap with acceptance criteria and rollback;
5. explicit user approval of the completed roadmap;
6. increment-specific research and a written plan before each increment;
7. coherent work chunks with tests, documentation, feedback, and evidence;
8. final verification that distinguishes local checks from
   controlled-environment qualification.

Use **increment**, not phase, in roadmap and status artifacts.

## Durable tracking

By default the skill creates:

- `docs/<slug>-implementation-roadmap.md` for approved intent;
- `docs/<slug>-implementation-report.md` for progress, evidence, feedback, and
  the next checkpoint;
- `.implementation-roadmaps/<slug>/state.json` as deterministic render state.

The files are repository-relative and should be tracked unless repository policy
requires a different location. The AI updates the report after a coherent chunk
or natural checkpoint and gives the user a clickable link. It does not update
the report after every individual file change.

The Markdown files are generated from JSON state. Direct edits are detected as
drift. The standard-library Python engine validates events, confines output
paths to the repository, writes files atomically, and never executes a recorded
command.

## Skill and helper boundary

- `skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps/` owns the user-invoked workflow,
  state engine, references, examples, and skill tests.
- `dev-tools/helpers/` owns generic contributor snapshots, repository check
  orchestration, and patch transport.

The skill can direct an agent to a bounded helper, but the helper must remain
useful without the skill. Generic developer tools should not move into the skill
solely because roadmap execution may call them.

## Installation

GitHub CLI 2.90 or later can discover `skills/*/SKILL.md` and install a
repository skill for supported agents:

```text
gh skill preview <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent codex --scope user
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent claude-code --scope user
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent github-copilot --scope user
```

For a trusted local checkout:

```text
gh skill install . manage-implementation-roadmaps --from-local --agent codex --scope project
```

Codex users may alternatively ask `$skill-installer` to install the published
`skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps` GitHub directory. See the skill's
`references/installation.md` for supported hosts, native locations, source
links, and publishing checks.

## Verification

Run:

```text
python -m unittest discover -s skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps/tests -p "test_*.py" -v
npm run docs:check
npm run agent-support:check
npm test
```

Use the creating host's skill validator and preview the repository package before
publishing.

## Maintenance and extension

When roadmap work exposes a repeated failure mode, decide whether it belongs to
the workflow, the bounded developer helpers, or product implementation:

- update the skill for approval, research, planning, feedback, tracking, resume,
  or evidence behavior;
- update a helper for a portable, bounded repository operation;
- update product code for application behavior.

Skill changes require:

- exact-name and natural-language trigger tests;
- positive workflow and resume tests;
- negative tests for path escape, malformed events, drift, and arbitrary command
  injection;
- no credentials, personal names, absolute local paths, or private task text;
- synchronized `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, skill references, and
  installation guidance.

Review future repetitive interactions for new skills or bounded helpers, but do
not combine unrelated authority or destructive behavior merely to reduce
prompts.
