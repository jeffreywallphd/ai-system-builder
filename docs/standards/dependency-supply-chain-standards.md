# Dependency and Supply-Chain Standards

- Status: accepted
- Verification: `npm run security:dependencies`, `npm test`

## Purpose

Dependency resolution, automated workflows, and release inputs are executable
parts of the product supply chain. They must be reproducible, reviewable, and
covered by fail-closed checks without disguising unresolved risk as an automatic
upgrade.

## Dependency resolution

- `package-lock.json` is tracked and is the authoritative npm dependency tree.
- CI and container builds use `npm ci`; they must not resolve a new dependency
  tree with `npm install`.
- Dependency changes include the manifest and lockfile in the same review.
- Runtime source imports only dependencies declared directly by the applicable
  root or workspace manifest; incidental access through a tool's transitive tree
  is not an application dependency boundary.
- Install lifecycle scripts remain disabled in validation and server-image
  dependency stages unless a separately reviewed build step requires them.
- Major runtime or packaging-tool upgrades require compatibility testing; do not
  apply `npm audit fix --force` or an unreviewed bulk remediation.

## Advisory policy

`npm run security:dependencies` evaluates two scopes:

- the production/runtime tree fails on any known advisory,
- the complete development toolchain also fails on any known advisory.

The scopes remain separate so runtime exposure and build/package exposure are
visible independently, but neither scope may carry known advisory debt. When an
upstream range has not adopted a patched transitive release, a narrow exact npm
override is permitted only after its affected command paths pass compatibility
tests. Network or malformed-registry responses fail the check rather than
producing a false pass.

## SBOM and workflow integrity

- The dependency security check generates and validates a production SPDX 2.3
  SBOM from the locked tree. Release automation may retain or attest that output;
  local validation does not write it into source control.
- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.
- Production and qualification container base images are pinned to full OCI
  digests. Tags remain alongside the digest for review clarity; automated Docker
  updates must refresh the reviewed digest rather than silently following a tag.
- Workflow permissions are least privilege and checkout credentials are not
  persisted when no later push is required.
- Dependabot proposes npm, GitHub Actions, and server Docker input updates for
  review; it does not merge or deploy them automatically.

## Review checklist

- Does the lockfile match every workspace manifest?
- Does `npm ci` succeed without modifying the tree?
- Are production and complete-toolchain advisories both at zero?
- Is every workflow action immutable by full commit SHA?
- Are build/runtime base images and qualification service images immutable by
  digest, and does the image scan block fixed critical findings?
- Were build, package, and runtime compatibility checks selected for the affected
  dependency rather than assuming semantic-version compatibility?
