# Testing Standards

## Purpose

Tests in `ai-system-builder` protect meaningful behavior and architectural intent.

They are not written to satisfy vanity coverage metrics or performative CI checks.

## Testing strategy by layer

## 1) Domain tests (unit-first)

Domain logic must be tested directly and in isolation.

Focus on:

- invariants,
- business rules,
- state transitions,
- value object/entity behavior.

Domain tests should not require infrastructure frameworks, database clients, or transport setup.

## 2) Application tests (use-case focused)

Application use cases should be tested with controlled boundaries.

Focus on:

- orchestration behavior,
- port interactions,
- success/failure path handling,
- policy decisions and error mapping at use-case level.

Use test doubles for ports where appropriate; do not replace use-case tests with adapter-heavy integration flows.

## 3) Adapter tests (focused integration)

Adapters require focused integration tests against their real boundary behavior.

Examples:

- persistence adapters with Postgres integration coverage,
- storage adapters with real filesystem/blob behavior (or faithful local substitutes),
- transport adapters with request/response translation verification,
- runtime adapters with protocol and error translation checks.

Keep integration scope tight and purpose-driven.

## 4) Host and transport boundary tests

Hosts and transport boundaries should receive targeted integration tests for:

- composition correctness,
- startup/shutdown behavior,
- boundary wiring correctness,
- critical route/IPC to use-case delegation paths.

Do not treat end-to-end host tests as substitutes for domain/application testing.

## 5) UI tests

UI tests should validate behavior that matters:

- user-visible state transitions,
- contract-driven interactions,
- shared UI behavior reused across surfaces.

Prefer focused component/integration tests over brittle snapshot-only approaches.

## Required behavior coverage

At minimum, tests should cover:

- core business rules and invariants,
- major use-case success and failure paths,
- boundary translation behavior (transport/runtime/persistence/storage),
- previously observed defect paths (regressions),
- architecture-significant behavior called out in ADRs/architecture docs.

## Contract family invariant tests

For shared contract families, add or maintain invariant tests that protect canonical family rules.

For major contract systems, add cross-family invariant tests in `tests` folders that
exercise the intended relationships between families and fail when those relationships drift.

Minimum invariant expectations include:

- transport/API/IPC remain specialization-aligned (shared transport envelope semantics, no parallel contract systems),
- operation identity normalization stays helper-driven and transport-neutral across families,
- IPC channel derivation remains operation-bound (`ipc.<operation>.<kind>`) rather than ad hoc,
- runtime diagnostics remain a specialization of shared logging diagnostics and map directly to structured logs,
- persistence record references and record-targeted operations remain aligned,
- storage identity remains key-based and path-agnostic,
- persistence/storage remain mechanically distinct (record operations vs artifact-key operations),
- family barrels export only family-owned contract surfaces.

These tests belong near the contract families and should fail fast when drift is introduced.

## Regression test rule

When fixing a bug, add a regression test when practical in the layer where the defect should have been caught.

If no regression test is added, include explicit rationale in the PR.

## Test naming and structure

- Use explicit behavior-oriented test names.
- Keep naming consistent with repository naming standards.
- Recommended suffixes:
  - `*.unit.test.ts`
  - `*.integration.test.ts`
  - `*.ui.test.tsx`

Describe expected behavior and context in test titles; avoid vague names.

## Mocking discipline

Use mocks/stubs/fakes deliberately.

Rules:

- mock at architectural boundaries, not internal implementation details,
- do not over-mock domain behavior that can be tested directly,
- avoid brittle tests that assert private call sequences without behavioral value,
- use representative fixture data tied to domain language.

## Determinism and flake avoidance

Tests must be deterministic and CI-suitable.

Requirements:

- control time/randomness with explicit seams,
- isolate filesystem/network/process side effects,
- ensure test order independence,
- enforce reliable setup/teardown for shared resources,
- avoid hidden external dependencies.

Flaky tests are treated as defects and must be fixed or quarantined with a tracked follow-up.

## CI suitability

Test suites should be structured for predictable CI execution:

- fast feedback for unit tests,
- scoped integration runs for boundary confidence,
- clear failure output that points to behavior regressions,
- no reliance on local-only developer state.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Coverage-only tests with no behavioral assertion value.
- Snapshot churn that obscures real regressions.
- Tests that mirror implementation line-by-line instead of behavior.
- Massive end-to-end suites used as a replacement for layered tests.
- Asserting framework internals instead of system behavior.

## Practical review checklist

Before merging:

- Are important business and boundary behaviors actually protected?
- Do tests reflect architecture boundaries rather than collapsing them?
- Is new behavior covered at the appropriate layer?
- Is bug-fix regression coverage included when practical?
- Are tests deterministic and CI-reliable?

If any answer is “no”, test quality is insufficient.
