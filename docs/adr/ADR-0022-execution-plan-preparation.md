# ADR-0022: Execution Plan Preparation

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

## Context

runtime readiness binding established runtime readiness bindings as workspace-scoped, non-executing readiness records that summarize setup choices, capability references, blockers, and diagnostics without invoking providers or running workflows.

The next architectural step needs a planning layer that converts readiness-backed composition context into inspectable execution intent for future orchestration, while preserving strict no-execution boundaries.

## Decision

execution plan preparation introduces workspace-scoped execution plan preparation that converts ready runtime readiness binding runtime readiness bindings into safe, inspectable execution plan candidates. These plans describe intended steps, dependencies, inputs, outputs, adapter references, safety gates, blockers, diagnostics, and optional resource estimates, but do not execute workflows, invoke providers, install dependencies, download models, generate executable payloads, or run runtimes.

## Accepted execution plan preparation boundaries

- execution plan preparation owns non-executing planning metadata only.
- execution plan preparation outputs execution plan candidates/previews for user/system inspection in Assets / Plans / Setup (no separate top-level Execution Plans page).
- execution plan preparation preserves conservative blocker-first semantics when readiness or planning completeness is insufficient.

## Execution plan ownership and workspace scope

- Execution plans are workspace-scoped records.
- Execution plans reference a source composition plan and source runtime readiness binding.
- Execution plans remain planning records, including archived historical records.

## Depend on runtime readiness binding runtime readiness bindings

execution plan preparation must consume readiness metadata through runtime readiness binding binding semantics (safe setup selections and safe capability/provider references). It must not bypass readiness by directly reading provider adapters, credentials, raw environment values, or raw local paths.

## Keep execution plan preparation non-executing

Execution plan preparation, preflight, and dry-run in execution plan preparation are planning-only checks. They must not invoke providers, execute workflows, start runtimes, install dependencies, or download models.

## Use safe execution plan candidates/previews

execution plan preparation plan records and previews must stay sanitized and non-runnable:

- no command lines,
- no workflow payloads for execution,
- no provider invocation payloads,
- no secrets/credentials,
- no raw paths/environment values,
- no bytes/blobs/base64/signed URLs.

## Defer provider/runtime invocation

Provider/model/runtime invocation and execution lifecycle ownership are deferred to controlled conversational execution orchestration work.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear architectural seam between readiness and execution orchestration.
- Safer review surface before any execution-capable phase.
- Deterministic blocker/diagnostic posture for incomplete readiness/input/output/safety states.

### Tradeoffs

- Additional state modeling and anti-drift constraints are required.
- Users may see plans marked `ready-for-review` that are not runnable, requiring clear UX language.

## Explicit non-goals

execution plan preparation does not implement runtime/workflow/model/ComfyUI execution, provider invocation, dependency installation, model download, credential/secret creation/storage, shell command execution, environment mutation, executable payload generation, artifact generation, job lifecycle/progress/cancellation, runtime logs, marketplace behavior, collaboration, pack import/export, live cross-workspace synchronization, or source-record mutation.

## Relationship to runtime readiness binding

execution plan preparation is downstream from runtime readiness binding readiness bindings. If readiness is stale, blocked, invalid, missing, or otherwise insufficient, execution plan preparation must emit execution-plan blockers/statuses instead of bypassing readiness.

## Relationship To Controlled Conversational Execution

controlled conversational execution (Execution Orchestration and Controlled Runtime Invocation) may consume prepared execution plans to perform invocation, lifecycle management, progress, cancellation, recovery, and audit behaviors. execution plan preparation supplies planning metadata and gate outcomes only.


## Controlled Execution Payload Boundary

execution plan preparation exposes only safe planning metadata (workspace/plan/source ids, status, planned steps/inputs/outputs/dependencies, safe adapter references, safety gates, resource estimates, blockers, diagnostics, provenance summary). It must not expose credentials, secrets, raw env values, command lines, local paths, storage roots, raw workflow JSON, provider invocation payloads, runnable graphs, executable payloads, bytes/blobs/base64, or signed URLs.
