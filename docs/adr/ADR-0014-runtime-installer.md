# ADR-0014: Runtime Installer Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Problem

Runtime sidecars may require local installation before they can be started and used. ComfyUI is the first concrete example in this repository, but it will not be the only runtime target over time.

Future runtime targets may include additional GitHub/Git-installed sidecars, archive/binary-installed sidecars, or package-manager-driven local runtimes.

Installer behavior must not be embedded directly in UI code or feature-specific use cases. Installation must remain behind clean architecture boundaries so runtime targets and installation strategies can evolve without leaking infrastructure concerns into domain/application feature logic.

## Decision

Introduce a generic **Runtime Installer** abstraction.

- Runtime installer responsibilities are separate from runtime supervisor responsibilities.
- Supervisors may call installer operations before startup when configured to do so.
- Installation targets are runtime-specific, but they share common install request/result/status contracts and application ports.

## Layering

- **Contracts** define install target/source/request/result/status semantics.
- **Application port** defines generic install and status operations.
- **Adapters** implement concrete install strategies.
- **Runtime-specific adapters** (for example ComfyUI) compose generic installers with target defaults, without changing shared contracts.

## Runtime Target Model

- Runtime install targets are identified by stable target ids (not UI labels).
- Examples:
  - `comfyui`
  - `python-worker`
  - `future-diffusers`
- Target-specific adapters may provide target defaults (install root conventions, source defaults, safety flags) while preserving generic contracts.

## Source Model

Initial source type:

- `git`

Planned future source types:

- `archive`
- `local-path`
- `package-manager`

Source-specific fields are modeled in contract unions so adapters can evolve source handling without cross-layer coupling.

## Install State

Installer status model:

- `not-installed`
- `installing`
- `checking`
- `installed`
- `update-available`
- `failed`
- `unknown`

## Install Metadata

Installer request/result/status flows may include:

- `installRoot`
- `targetId`
- `source`
- `requestedRef`
- `resolvedRef` / `commitSha` (when available)
- `installedAt`
- `lastCheckedAt`
- `error` and `warnings`

## Safety Rules

- Do not overwrite non-empty unmanaged directories.
- Do not delete user files.
- Installer operations must be idempotent.
- Repair/update behavior must be explicit (opt-in), not implicit.
- Force-repair for unmanaged non-empty directories must remain non-destructive and may fail safely until an explicit safe strategy is designed.
- CUDA torch dependency installation may use a user-configured PyTorch wheel index URL, but it must stay inside the managed Python dependency stage and must not require UI code to run installer commands directly.
- DirectML dependency repair is scoped to managed Python dependencies; it should not implicitly mutate repository refs or delete runtime/model files.

## ComfyUI DirectML Startup Repair Behavior

- ComfyUI startup can fail on some DirectML/Intel paths with native mismatch signatures (`torchaudio`, `WinError 127`, missing procedure symbols).
- Supervisor-level startup handling detects those signatures from startup failure output.
- On detection, supervisor triggers one installer `repairInstall` pass with update disabled, then retries startup once.
- The flow is bounded (single retry only) to prevent infinite loops.
- If repair fails, users receive an actionable dependency-repair error; if retry fails, users receive an actionable post-repair startup error.

## Non-Goals (Prompt 1/4)

- No Git clone/fetch/reset implementation.
- No ComfyUI install implementation.
- No UI implementation for install flows.

## Metadata Persistence

- Runtime installers should persist install metadata under the install root or in a target-specific metadata file.
- Metadata should record source, requested ref, resolved ref/commit SHA, installedAt, lastCheckedAt, and an ownership/managed marker.
- A managed marker is required before repair/update modifies an existing non-empty directory.
- Managed metadata must be validated (shape + required ownership/source fields) before an install is treated as managed.
- Exact metadata filename is implementation-defined in Prompt 2; suggested default: `.ai-system-builder-runtime-install.json`.
- For Git sources: fetch should run before update checks; pinned refs/tags/SHAs should be checked out and recorded without implicit pull, while unpinned sources may use fast-forward pull.
