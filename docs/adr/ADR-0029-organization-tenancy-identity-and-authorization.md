## Context

Local desktop use is intentionally zero-service and single-user. Campus,
corporate, and cloud deployments need authenticated users, explicit ownership,
shared-server isolation, resource authorization, and durable audit evidence.
The current workspace actor/member fields are passive attribution only, LAN
device scopes enforce coarse route access only, and PostgreSQL structured
documents have no tenant partition key.

Selecting a tenant model changes public request contracts, workspace and User
Library ownership, PostgreSQL keys and policies, security composition, data
migration, audit records, and the object-storage keyspace. Those commitments
must be one coherent decision before shared multi-user behavior or tenant-aware
object storage is implemented.

## Research basis

- [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-18.html)
  defines authentication on OAuth 2.0 and identifies the issuer and subject
  claim pair as the stable external end-user identifier; mutable claims such as
  email are not identity keys.
- [OWASP authorization guidance](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  recommends least privilege, deny by default, permission validation on every
  request, appropriate logging, and authorization-specific tests.
- [AWS SaaS partitioning guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/multi-tenant-saas-storage-strategies/saas-partitioning-models.html)
  distinguishes silo, bridge, and pool storage. A pool uses shared schema and a
  tenant partition key, while silo and bridge trade higher isolation for higher
  provisioning and operating cost.
- [AWS PostgreSQL tenancy guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/saas-multitenant-managed-postgresql/matrix.html)
  identifies pooled tables as the fastest-onboarding PostgreSQL model and
  separate databases or schemas as higher-isolation, higher-management-cost
  alternatives.
- [Microsoft multitenant data guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/approaches/storage-data)
  recommends an explicit tenant identifier for shared relational tables and
  notes that row-level security requires tenant identity to reach every query.
- [PostgreSQL row-security guidance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html)
  documents default denial when row security is enabled without an applicable
  policy, as well as the table-owner and `BYPASSRLS` exceptions that must be
  removed from the application role.
- [PostgreSQL configuration guidance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html)
  provides transaction-local configuration through `set_config`, allowing a
  checked tenant identifier to be bound to one transaction without leaking
  through a pooled session.

## Options

### A. Pooled organization tenancy with row-level security

Managed deployments share one schema. Every organization-owned row carries an
immutable organization identifier in its relational key. Application policy
authorizes the principal, organization membership, operation, and resource;
PostgreSQL row-level security supplies a second isolation boundary.

- Benefits: one contract model across campus, corporate, and cloud; efficient
  onboarding and upgrades; supports multi-organization cloud use; leaves room
  for later tenant placement behind adapters.
- Costs: the tenant context must be propagated without omission; migration and
  policy tests are substantial; pooled capacity needs noisy-neighbor controls.

### B. One organization per deployment

Each managed installation serves one organization, while its users still use
external identity and authorization.

- Benefits: simplest operational isolation and easiest campus rollout.
- Costs: cannot provide a shared multi-organization cloud control plane without
  a later breaking tenancy change; duplicated deployments and upgrades become
  the isolation mechanism.

### C. Separate database per organization

The shared application selects and operates a dedicated database for each
organization.

- Benefits: strongest data-plane isolation and tenant-specific backup/restore.
- Costs: pool routing, migrations, recovery, observability, provisioning, and
  cross-organization administration scale with tenant count; local and small
  campus deployments pay complexity they do not need.

## Proposed decision

Choose option A as the default managed-server model while retaining an adapter
boundary that can place selected organizations in dedicated databases later.

- **Tenant definition:** an organization is the tenant. A workspace belongs to
  exactly one organization and cannot be reassigned by ordinary update flows.
  A user may belong to multiple organizations and must select an organization
  explicitly; membership is not inferred from token scopes or email domains.
- **Local profile:** local desktop creates one durable local organization and
  one local principal during explicit first-run setup or migration. It uses the
  same organization-aware application contracts without requiring OIDC or a
  network service. The identifiers are generated and persisted, not hard-coded
  global constants.
- **Managed identity:** campus, corporate, and cloud hosts use a swappable OIDC
  authentication adapter. The trusted issuer plus subject pair maps to one
  internal principal identifier. Email, username, display name, and provider
  organization claims are attributes only.
- **Request context:** authenticated operations carry an immutable principal,
  selected organization, request/correlation identity, and authentication
  assurance from the host boundary into application use cases. Workspace-owned
  operations additionally carry the workspace identifier. Missing or
  mismatched context denies access; it never falls back to a global scope.
- **Authorization:** route scopes remain coarse transport gates. Application
  policy evaluates organization membership, role, operation, and resource on
  every protected use case and denies by default. Organization roles begin as
  `owner`, `admin`, and `member`; resource-specific grants require a successor
  decision instead of ad hoc role strings.
- **Persistence:** organization-owned structured documents add
  `organization_id` to their relational primary key. Platform records and
  deployment-local host configuration use explicit non-tenant classifications,
  not a nullable tenant field interpreted by convention. All organization-owned
  reads and writes execute inside a transaction with a transaction-local tenant
  setting.
- **PostgreSQL defense in depth:** organization-owned tables enable and force
  row-level security. The runtime application role is neither a superuser nor
  the table owner and has no `BYPASSRLS`; a separate migration role owns schema
  changes. Policies apply the checked transaction-local organization identifier
  to both visibility and mutation. Backup and migration tooling use explicit,
  separately controlled roles.
- **Audit:** authorization allows and denials, membership changes, tenant
  selection, privileged administration, and sensitive resource operations emit
  append-only structured audit records with actor, organization, operation,
  resource reference, outcome, timestamp, and correlation identifier. Audit
  events exclude tokens, raw claims, prompts, payload bodies, and local paths.
- **Storage alignment:** object keys are derived by storage adapters from typed
  ownership descriptors. Organization/workspace/principal identifiers form
  containment prefixes; callers never construct raw provider keys. Platform
  assets remain in a separate read-only scope.

## Acceptance-dependent implementation plan

1. Add organization, external-subject, membership, selected-organization, and
   request-security contracts with normalization and negative tests.
2. Add authorization and audit application ports/services; make resource-aware
   authorization mandatory at workspace and storage use-case boundaries.
3. Add explicit local-profile bootstrap/migration and OIDC verifier/mapping
   adapters, then compose them by deployment shape without changing use cases.
4. Introduce a versioned PostgreSQL tenancy migration, separate migration and
   runtime roles, transaction-local tenant binding, forced row-level-security
   policies, and live cross-pool isolation tests.
5. Propagate organization context through API, IPC, clients, host composition,
   typed repositories, health diagnostics, and sanitized audit sinks.
6. Migrate existing data only through an explicit organization-assignment
   command with inventory, rollback source, reconciliation, and no implicit
   assignment on ordinary startup.
7. Qualify local single-user behavior and managed multi-user denial paths before
   implementing the tenant-aware object-storage recommendation.

## Consequences if accepted

### Positive

- Local and managed shapes share ownership semantics without forcing a local
  identity provider.
- Cloud can serve multiple organizations efficiently, while future dedicated
  placement remains an adapter concern.
- Authorization mistakes must cross both application policy and database row
  security to expose another organization's structured data.
- Object storage receives a stable ownership boundary before provider-specific
  keys or lifecycle rules are committed.

### Negative

- Existing structured data needs explicit ownership assignment before managed
  multi-user activation.
- Every organization-owned operation and test fixture gains mandatory context.
- Row-level security, role separation, and pooled-connection context require live
  PostgreSQL qualification and careful operator tooling.
- Organization-level capacity isolation and dedicated-tenant placement remain
  later operational work.

## Deferred decisions

- Hybrid/offline synchronization and conflict authority.
- Organization-managed identity-provider onboarding and domain discovery.
- Fine-grained custom roles, groups, resource ACLs, and attribute-policy UI.
- Cross-organization sharing and organization libraries.
- Dedicated-database placement criteria, tenant moves, residency, and
  tenant-managed encryption keys.
- Public-internet ingress, session, abuse-prevention, and compliance claims
  beyond the identity and authorization boundaries in this proposal.
