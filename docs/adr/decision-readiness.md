# Architecture Decision Readiness

- Status: current
- Verification: `npm run docs:check`

This register tells contributors and automated agents whether architecture-sensitive work can proceed from existing decisions. It is a decision gate, not an ADR inventory, implementation backlog, or substitute for reading the linked sources.

## Readiness Values

- `ready`: accepted guidance is specific enough for work within its stated boundary.
- `constrained`: accepted guidance exists, but expansion beyond current behavior needs another decision.
- `proposed`: direction is recorded but has not been accepted as authority.
- `decision-required`: canonical docs explicitly leave materially different choices open.

## Current Decision Surface

| Area | Readiness | Authority and boundary | Agent action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository shape and dependency direction | ready | ADR-0001 and `docs/architecture/module-dependency-rules.md` | Follow the existing layers; changing dependency direction requires an ADR update or successor. |
| TypeScript-first application/runtime model | ready | ADR-0002; Python is isolated behind runtime boundaries by ADR-0010 | Keep domain/application/host code TypeScript-first and Python runtime details adapter-owned. |
| Desktop/server hosts and transport separation | ready | ADR-0003, ADR-0013, `docs/architecture/host-model.md` | Add behavior through application seams and host composition; do not move business policy into API/IPC/UI layers. |
| Persistence/storage separation and deployment defaults | constrained | ADR-0004, ADR-0025, ADR-0026, ADR-0027, and `docs/architecture/persistence-and-storage.md` separate blob/resource storage; desktop SQLite and managed-shape PostgreSQL composition plus explicit JSON import/cutover are implemented | Preserve the database-neutral repository seams. Hybrid synchronization, tenancy, retention objectives, and failover objectives still need decisions before being presented as supported. |
| Builder-core/platform/asset separation | proposed | ADR-0005 is proposed; ADR-0016 supplies the accepted Asset Kernel vocabulary and boundary | Use ADR-0016 and later accepted ADRs for Asset Kernel work. Do not use ADR-0005 alone to authorize new capability APIs or taxonomy. |
| Desktop and thin-client renderer structure and styling | ready | ADR-0006 and ADR-0007 | Preserve shared UI boundaries, platform clients, shared cross-surface styling layers, and platform-owned feature behavior. A separate design-system architecture requires a decision if introduced. |
| Ingestion and artifact identity/backing | ready | ADR-0008 and ADR-0009 | Extend through established domain/application/storage seams and preserve artifact-versus-storage distinctions. |
| Python runtime and runtime task registry | proposed | ADR-0010 and ADR-0011 are proposed even though corresponding behavior and tests exist | Maintain implemented, tested behavior within current architecture docs, but do not broaden runtime topology or lifecycle guarantees until the decisions are accepted or superseded. |
| Host-owned runtime placement, installers, and image generation | constrained | ADR-0012 through ADR-0014 plus runtime architecture docs | Implement supported capabilities through runtime ports, readiness, task registry, installers, and host ownership. New engines, generalized orchestration, or lifecycle guarantees need explicit decisions. |
| Security policy boundaries | constrained | ADR-0015 and the security architecture/context | Preserve current secure modes, policy seams, and sanitized diagnostics. OAuth, mTLS, external identity, encryption-at-rest, public-internet hardening, and complete audit architecture require explicit accepted decisions. |
| Asset Kernel, reuse, authoring, projections, composition, readiness, and execution planning | ready | ADR-0016 through ADR-0022 and their architecture docs | Work only inside each ADR's implemented/current boundary; capabilities marked deferred are not implied by the next layer. |
| System Builder product area and design-time record baseline | constrained | ADR-0024 and `docs/architecture/system-builder.md` define Systems placement, terminology, and contract specialization | The baseline record and truthful preparation UI may evolve. CRUD, persistence, transport, materialization, editing, execution handoff, and thin-client parity require scoped follow-up decisions and implementation evidence. |
| Controlled conversational execution | constrained | ADR-0023 and `docs/architecture/controlled-conversational-system-execution.md` | Preserve explicit approval, supported text-generation adapter boundaries, and truthful unsupported states. Streaming, tools, retrieval, memory, multimodal behavior, and arbitrary workflows require decisions and implementation evidence. |
| Desktop-to-server hybrid coordination and synchronization | decision-required | ADR-0003 and `docs/architecture/host-model.md` intentionally leave topology and coordination open | Do not invent routing, synchronization, conflict, offline, or ownership policy. Produce options and consequences for approval. |
| Organization tenancy, managed identity, and tenant isolation | ready | ADR-0029 accepts pooled organization tenancy by default, premium one-organization deployments over the same release, OIDC-backed managed identity, application authorization, PostgreSQL row security, and tenant-aligned storage | Implement only through explicit organization/request context, policy, persistence, storage, and placement seams. Do not create a premium code fork or infer tenant identity from email, workspace selection, or passive member fields. |
| Multi-user collaboration and shared libraries | constrained | ADR-0029 decides organization membership roles and isolation but defers invites, groups, custom roles, resource ACLs, cross-organization sharing, and organization libraries | Implement the accepted identity, membership, and isolation baseline only. Require a successor decision for broader collaboration or sharing semantics. |
| Public pack import/export, registry, and marketplace behavior | decision-required | Asset Kernel and system overview docs keep these surfaces deferred | Do not expose installation, marketplace, trust, signing, override, or distribution behavior without accepted trust and lifecycle decisions. |

## How to Use This Register

1. Locate the nearest row for the proposed change.
2. Read its linked ADR and architecture sources.
3. If `ready`, stay inside the stated boundary and apply the change-impact matrix.
4. If `constrained`, verify that the work does not cross the named constraint.
5. If `proposed` or `decision-required`, stop before implementation and present decision options, consequences, and affected boundaries.

When a decision is accepted, superseded, or materially constrained, update this register in the same change as the ADR and affected architecture/context docs.
