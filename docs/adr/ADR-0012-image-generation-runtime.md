# ADR-0012: Image Generation Runtime Architecture and Contracts

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The platform needs image generation as a first-class capability while preserving clean architecture boundaries established for runtime-backed AI work.

Existing long-running runtime flows (dataset preparation and model training) already use async lifecycle semantics through runtime task contracts. Image generation must align with that lifecycle model instead of introducing a separate execution pattern.

The system also needs to support engine variability over time (ComfyUI, local Python libraries, remote APIs) without leaking engine-specific structures into domain/application contracts.

## Decision

Image generation is established as a **first-class feature** with execution managed through the **Runtime Task Registry** lifecycle.

- Image generation execution uses `RuntimeTaskRegistryPort` lifecycle operations (`startTask`, `getTaskStatus`, `cancelTask`).
- ComfyUI is treated as a runtime sidecar implementation detail, not a domain dependency.
- Image generation contracts remain engine-agnostic and do not encode ComfyUI workflow graph structures.

## Key Principles

- Contracts must not contain UI-specific or ComfyUI-specific payload structures.
- Image generation follows the same async task lifecycle as dataset preparation and model training.
- Generated outputs are represented as assets with stable identity and metadata.
- Artifacts remain storage-backed objects; artifacts do not replace assets as semantic entities.

## Architecture

Layered execution flow:

Renderer/UI
→ Application Use Case
→ ImageGenerationPort (engine abstraction)
→ RuntimeTaskRegistryPort
→ Runtime Adapter (ComfyUI, future engines)
→ Sidecar (ComfyUI server)

Boundary responsibilities:

- Renderer/UI requests generation via application APIs only.
- Application orchestrates validation and lifecycle calls through ports.
- Runtime adapters map generic requests/results to engine-specific runtime calls.
- Sidecars execute generation workloads and return outputs for artifact + asset registration.

## Asset Model

`ImageAsset` (conceptual contract target):

- `assetId`
- `artifactId`
- `source`: `uploaded` | `generated`
- `metadata`:
  - `prompt`
  - `negativePrompt`
  - `seed`
  - `model`
  - `engine`
  - `workflowTemplateId`
  - `dimensions`
  - `createdAt`

Clarifications:

- Assets carry identity + meaning for product behavior.
- Artifacts provide storage backing and retrieval mechanics.
- Generated images must be registered as assets.
- Uploaded images may be promoted to assets in future workflows.

## Runtime Model

- Add `TaskType.IMAGE_GENERATION` to shared runtime task taxonomy.
- All image generation execution uses Runtime Task Registry lifecycle operations:
  - `startTask`
  - `getTaskStatus`
  - `cancelTask`

## Engine Strategy

- ComfyUI is the first runtime engine implementation.
- Future engines include local diffusers-based runtimes and remote/cloud APIs.
- Engine-specific request mapping, workflow translation, and adapter quirks are confined to runtime adapters only.

## Non-Goals (This Prompt)

- No UI implementation
- No ComfyUI workflow editor
- No model downloading workflows
- No ControlNet or advanced generation features
- No runtime adapter/client implementation changes

## Consequences

## Host-owned execution clarification

Image-generation execution is host-owned. Desktop-local and server-side ComfyUI runtime instances are independent by default, including host-specific ComfyUI install roots, Python environments, runtime process state, and runtime caches.

Runtime roots are separate from artifact storage roots. Generated images must be finalized into the executing host's artifact storage. Thin-client flows must not rely on ComfyUI temp output paths or server filesystem paths.

Future desktop-remote image generation (not yet implemented) should return server-owned artifact/image references through desktop IPC-facing APIs, or explicitly localize/import artifacts when local copies are required. Model/checkpoint resolution belongs to the executing host's model registry/checkpoint resolver, not UI components.

### Positive

- Preserves strict layer boundaries and contract purity.
- Enables future engine additions without contract churn.
- Reuses shared async lifecycle semantics and operational patterns.

### Tradeoffs

- Requires adapter mapping work in follow-up prompts.
- Defers engine-specific power-user features until boundary contracts are stable.

## Separation of Concerns

- Contracts define intent and shared semantics only; they do not encode runtime-specific payloads.
- Runtime payload mapping is performed in adapters at execution boundaries.
- `ImageGenerationRequest` is not equivalent to a ComfyUI workflow definition.
- Asset registration occurs after runtime completion in the application layer, not in the runtime adapter layer.

## Runtime Installer Alignment (Prompt 1/4)

- ComfyUI may be auto-installed through the Runtime Installer abstraction before runtime startup, based on host/runtime configuration.
- ComfyUI supervisor integration with installer pre-start checks is deferred to a later prompt.
- Installation concerns remain separate from image generation contracts and use-case orchestration.
