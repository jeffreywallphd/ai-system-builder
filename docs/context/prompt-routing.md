# Prompt Routing

Use this guide to select **minimum-sufficient** context packs. Start with `index.pack.md`, then add only packs that materially affect the requested work.

## Baseline

- Always include `docs/context/packs/index.pack.md`.
- Read `docs/README.md` before assembling task context.
- Use `docs/context/pack-catalog.json` for machine-readable task/path signals and applicable checks.
- Default to no more than two additional packs: one primary concern and one adjacent boundary.
- Add another pack only after repository search proves that boundary is materially affected; for broad work, stage context and implementation by boundary instead of preloading everything.
- Packs are routing aids and compact summaries; canonical ADRs, architecture docs, and standards win on conflict.

## Common Pack Chains

- Debugging: `index` + `debugging-error-handling` + the single pack owning the first failing seam.
- Image generation defect: `index` + `image-generation`; add only one of `runtime`, `runtime-task-registry`, `runtime-installer`, `persistence-storage`, or the affected host after localization.
- Asset Library/Registry: `index` + `asset-kernel` + the affected UI, transport/host, persistence, or security pack.
- Workspace-scoped persistence: `index` + the owning feature pack + `persistence-storage`; load security or a host pack only when that boundary also changes.
- User Library: `index` + `user-library` + either `asset-kernel` for semantics or `persistence-storage` for repository behavior.
- Asset authoring: `index` + `asset-authoring` + either `asset-kernel`, `user-library`, or `effective-asset-projections` based on the adjacent behavior.
- Projection/composition/readiness/planning: select the one owning layer plus one immediate neighbor; move forward through the chain in separate reasoning stages.
- Controlled conversational execution: `index` + `controlled-conversational-system-execution`; add the execution-plan or runtime pack only when that exact boundary changes.
- Security: `index` + `security` + the one public host/client/feature boundary being changed.
- Desktop renderer styling: `index` + `desktop-styling` + `desktop-implementation`.

## Canonical Escalation Rules

Read and update canonical docs when the task:

- changes architecture, repository structure, standards, or documented behavior,
- changes dependency direction, host/transport/runtime responsibility, persistence/storage responsibility, security policy, or workspace scope,
- changes Asset Kernel semantics, pack/source semantics, mutation behavior, resolver behavior, or public transport/UI exposure,
- exposes a context-pack summary that is incomplete, stale, or ambiguous.

Before architecture-sensitive implementation, consult `docs/adr/decision-readiness.md`. Proposed or decision-required areas must return to decision work instead of being implemented from inference.

## Boundary Split Rules

- Do not combine API/server-host, IPC/preload/desktop-host, and desktop/thin-client parity implementation into one prompt unless the user explicitly asks for a cross-boundary implementation.
- Do not add host/API/IPC/UI exposure while working on contracts/application services unless the prompt explicitly includes that surface.
- Do not include runtime/provider/storage packs for read-only UI tasks unless those boundaries are directly touched.
- Do not include all phase packs for asset work; include the narrow chain that matches the task.

## Stop Condition

- If required canonical guidance is missing, unclear, or conflicting, update or request clarification for the canonical docs rather than inventing policy silently.
