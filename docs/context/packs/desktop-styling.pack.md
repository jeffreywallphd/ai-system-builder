# Context Pack: Desktop Styling

- Pack name: `desktop-styling`

## Purpose

- Keep desktop and thin-client renderer styling disciplined, layered, token-first, and visually aligned.
- Preserve the corporate navy-and-blue dark palette while preventing cross-surface duplication and CSS sprawl.

## Use When

- Adding or refactoring CSS in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/**`.
- Changing shared visual rules consumed by both `apps/desktop` and `apps/thin-client`.
- Creating shared renderer layout/component style primitives.
- Reviewing where new renderer styles should live.

## Do Not Use When

- Tasks with no renderer styling impact.
- Server/host/runtime work that does not change desktop or thin-client CSS structure.

## Core Guidance

- Treat renderer styling as token-first; use `modules/ui/shared/styles/tokens.css` before introducing direct values.
- Preserve the corporate dark palette baseline unless an intentional design decision explicitly changes it.
- Keep style layering order: tokens → reset → typography → shared layout → shared components → feature/page-local styles.
- Keep `modules/ui/shared/styles/application.css` as the ordered shared layer entrypoint.
- Keep both app-local `styles/app.css` files small; they import the shared entrypoint and platform-only extensions.
- Keep shared styles in `modules/ui/shared/styles/layout/*` and `modules/ui/shared/styles/components/*`.
- Keep feature/page styles near their application owner only when the rule cannot be reused by the other surface.
- Keep namespaced and consistent class names (`ui-*` for shared renderer styles; feature-specific naming inside owned scopes).
- Keep app-local route and feature availability unchanged when refactoring the shared shell; matching presentation does not imply matching capabilities.
- Keep wide-screen sidebar collapse behavior and its local visual preference aligned across desktop and thin-client shells; narrow viewports continue to use the compact menu.
- Keep wide-screen navigation sections as semantic, independently collapsible disclosure groups. Global collapse must let the page content consume the reclaimed width without changing route availability.
- Reuse shared action icons, feature-panel headings, bordered tab states, and colored artifact type badges. Keep visible text and source metadata alongside visual designators.
- Reuse `WorkflowSequence` and `WorkflowStep` for ordered, multi-stage task surfaces. Keep each feature's behavior and state local while sharing numbered cards, connecting rails, field grids, and review/action presentation.
- Keep decorative page illustrations shared, text-free, responsive, and hidden from assistive technology. Do not encode state or feature behavior in artwork.

## Key Constraints

- Do not grow a giant global stylesheet.
- Do not place page-specific rules in either top-level app stylesheet.
- Do not duplicate shared component patterns across multiple feature/page style files.
- Do not restore parallel desktop and thin-client copies of tokens, shell, controls, panels, tabs, home, or shared feature-surface styles.
- Do not add style files with no current usage.
- Do not introduce a new one-off visual pattern for each component when existing shared patterns fit.

## Canonical Source Docs

- `docs/adr/ADR-0007-desktop-renderer-styling-foundation-and-layering.md` — accepted renderer styling baseline, cross-surface ownership, and layering decision.
- `docs/adr/ADR-0006-desktop-implementation-boundaries-and-renderer-structure.md` — renderer ownership boundaries and composition model.
- `docs/context/prompt-routing.md` — minimum-sufficient pack selection and assembly rules.
- `docs/standards/coding-standards.md` — implementation restraint and anti-overbuild discipline.
- `docs/standards/naming-standards.md` — naming consistency expectations.

## Common Over-Inclusions to Avoid

- Loading broad server/runtime packs for renderer-only CSS tasks.
- Copying old app-wide style systems wholesale into either renderer.
- Expanding styling docs into component catalogs or speculative design-system policy.

## Prompt Assembly Notes

- Typical styling set: `index` → `desktop-implementation` → `desktop-styling`.
- Add `docs-standards` when the task introduces or changes styling ADRs or context packs.
- Add `testing` for shared shell, responsive navigation, or shared entrypoint changes because both application surfaces are affected.
- Keep prompts minimum-sufficient: include only touched styling layers and relevant canonical references.
