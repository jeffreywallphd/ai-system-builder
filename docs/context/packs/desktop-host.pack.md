# Context Pack: Desktop Host

- Pack name: `desktop-host`

## Purpose

- Provide focused guidance for desktop host composition and Electron boundary discipline.

## Use When

- Working in `apps/desktop`.
- Working in `modules/hosts/desktop`.
- Implementing/changing Electron `main`, preload, IPC, window lifecycle, or desktop bootstrap wiring.

## Do Not Use When

- Server-only transport/host tasks.
- Runtime or domain/application changes with no desktop-host impact.

## Core Guidance

- Desktop is a host model, not the entire architecture.
- Electron and Electron Forge are the desktop host/build tooling path.
- Preload and IPC are transport/boundary mechanics, not business logic layers.
- Keep business policy and use-case orchestration in application/domain, not `main`/preload/IPC glue.
- Desktop host code should compose adapters and lifecycle behavior, then delegate inward.
- Electron-specific assumptions must not leak into shared application/domain contracts.

## Key Constraints

- Do not turn IPC handlers into a miscellaneous service layer.
- Keep desktop transport translation thin and contract-driven.
- Preserve compatibility with multi-host architecture by avoiding desktop-only coupling in core layers.

## Canonical Source Docs

- `docs/architecture/host-model.md` — host responsibilities and desktop-first staging.
- `docs/adr/ADR-0003-host-model-and-transport-separation.md` — separation of host lifecycle and transport concerns.
- `docs/architecture/module-dependency-rules.md` — dependency boundaries for hosts and adapters.
- `docs/standards/coding-standards.md` — anti-patterns around host/transport logic leakage.
- `docs/standards/logging-standards.md` — startup and boundary diagnostics expectations.

## Common Over-Inclusions to Avoid

- Loading server host/API transport guidance for desktop-only tasks.
- Treating Electron API details as architectural rules for all modules.
- Pulling persistence/storage deep detail unless desktop work changes those boundaries.

## Prompt Assembly Notes

- Typical set: `index` + `desktop-host`.
- Add `architecture` for cross-layer changes.
- Add `logging` for startup/IPC diagnostics and `testing` for regression-sensitive changes.
