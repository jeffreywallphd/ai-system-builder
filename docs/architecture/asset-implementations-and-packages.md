# Asset Implementations and Packages

- Status: current
- Implementation: the executable implementation kernel plus bounded package inspection, admission, installation, activation, disable, and rollback workflows are current across desktop and server/thin-client hosts
- Related decisions: ADR-0016, ADR-0018, ADR-0019, ADR-0030, ADR-0031, ADR-0034
- Verification: `docs/architecture/architecture-verification.md`

## Purpose

This architecture adds executable or declarative behavior to semantic assets without placing code in Asset Kernel records. It governs implementation drafts, immutable releases, definition bindings, package inspection/admission, trust, compatibility, and functional system defaults.

## Boundary model

```txt
AssetDefinition (semantic contract)
        |
        | exact reference
        v
AssetImplementationBinding ---- trust/activation policy
        |
        v
AssetImplementationRelease ---- immutable metadata + facet descriptors
        |
        +---- source/package/evidence/SBOM artifacts (opaque storage keys)
        +---- compatibility + capability requirements
        +---- provenance + signature/digest evidence
        +---- revocation/disable policy (separate records)
```

Asset Kernel remains authoritative for definitions, instances, ports, bindings, compositions, requirements, validation vocabulary, and provenance summaries. The implementation family owns source/build/release lifecycles. Artifact storage owns bytes. Runtime adapters own execution.

## Canonical records

| Record                          | Mutability                  | Scope                         | Responsibility                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AssetImplementationDraft`      | mutable with revision token | workspace                     | authoring intent and current source snapshot reference             |
| `AssetSourceSnapshot`           | immutable                   | workspace/organization        | content digest and source artifact descriptor                      |
| `AssetImplementationBuild`      | immutable attempt record    | workspace/organization        | toolchain inputs, status, bounded log/evidence references          |
| `AssetImplementationRelease`    | immutable                   | workspace/organization/system | facets, digests, compatibility, capabilities, provenance, evidence |
| `AssetImplementationBinding`    | revisioned policy record    | workspace/organization/system | exact definition-to-release association and activation state       |
| `AssetImplementationRevocation` | append-only                 | authority scope               | reason, authority, timestamp, affected digest/identity             |

The structured records use opaque identifiers, media types, digests, byte sizes, and storage keys. They reject code strings, raw package bytes, source files, filesystem paths, credentials, environment values, provider payloads, and unbounded logs.

## Facets

One release may expose multiple independently compatible facets:

- `ui`: sandboxed browser bundle or trusted built-in UI registry entry;
- `logic`: bounded capability-based operation;
- `workflow`: finite typed orchestration definition or interpreter binding;
- `data`: schema/query/entity behavior through authorized data capabilities;
- `migration`: analyzed migration bundle, applied only by host-owned migration services;
- `policy`: declarative policy compiled by platform policy services;
- `test`: fixtures, contracts, and release qualification descriptors;
- `declarative`: implementation interpreted by a trusted platform engine.

Facet descriptors declare entry identity, ABI/API version, target environment, capability requests, content digest, and artifact reference. They do not contain executable payloads.

## Deterministic resolution

Resolution input is explicit and frozen where reproducibility matters:

- exact definition reference;
- active bindings visible to the workspace/organization;
- deployment profile and host/runtime capability inventory;
- trust/admission policy;
- required facets and port/configuration contracts;
- version and digest lock constraints;
- revocation and disable state.

The resolver returns exactly one permitted release or a safe diagnostic. It never chooses silently among equal candidates, ignores revocation, downgrades outside policy, installs dependencies, or executes code.

## Package lifecycle

```txt
source received
  -> quarantine
  -> bounded inspect (never execute)
  -> digest/signature/provenance/schema/compatibility/capability checks
  -> authorized admission decision
  -> immutable install
  -> scoped activation/binding
  -> disable / rollback / revocation
```

The first supported transport is a bounded JSON `.aisb-package` v1 container with uncompressed base64 entries. Unknown compression, links, and archive extraction are rejected rather than delegated to a general-purpose extractor. Package descriptors align with OCI content-addressed manifest semantics so an organization OCI-registry adapter can be introduced later. Public marketplace discovery remains outside this architecture.

Package parsing must reject absolute/device/traversal paths, links, duplicate normalized paths, invalid names, excessive files, excessive compressed or expanded size, excessive ratios, unsupported algorithms, mismatched digests, duplicate identities, unsupported format/runtime versions, and unknown required capabilities.

## Trust and provenance

Trust is an evaluated result, not a source label:

- `system-trusted`: shipped and digest-locked with the product;
- `organization-approved`: admitted by an organization policy authority;
- `workspace-approved`: explicitly admitted for one workspace where policy permits;
- `quarantined`, `unverified`, `rejected`, or `revoked`: not eligible for activation/execution.

Signature verification, SLSA-compatible provenance, SBOM, dependency scanning, and build evidence contribute to admission. None independently proves code safety. Execution policy still applies after admission.

## Functional foundation

`system.foundation` definitions stay host-neutral. Functional behavior comes from exact bindings to trusted built-in or declarative implementation releases. A default is advertised as usable only when its required facet resolves on the current deployment profile.

Foundation upgrades publish a new immutable pack version. Exact old references continue to resolve if not revoked and retained. Deprecation supplies replacement guidance and support dates; it never rewrites a consumer's lock.

The current `system.foundation@1.0.0` construction kit has 87 exact semantic
definitions. The functional-default catalog maps every definition to a closed
entry key, facet, deployment compatibility set, bounded preview fixture, and
trusted built-in or declarative-engine release. The shared Catalog preview is
available to desktop and thin-client renderers and has no external side
effects. Policy and security entries deny by default and request no authority;
platform authorization remains authoritative. Record-form, data-preview, and
basic-assistant composites reference the same lower-level definitions and
typed composition model used by System Builder.

## Ownership and dependency direction

```txt
contracts/asset-implementation
  <- application ports/services/use-cases
  <- persistence, storage, package, signature, scan, sandbox adapters
  <- desktop/server host composition
  <- API/IPC/preload clients
  <- shared desktop/thin-client UI
```

No UI imports persistence, package parsers, sandbox adapters, or host composition. No implementation contract imports React, Electron, Express, PostgreSQL, SQLite, filesystem, registry, container, or provider types.

## Current implementation status

`AssetImplementationRelease`, facet, binding, artifact, resolver, and package
lifecycle contract families are implemented. A package is quarantined in
immutable artifact storage, inspected without execution, and admitted only
after the stored bytes are reread and reinspected. Workspace admission requires
verified provenance and SBOM evidence plus exact capability consent;
organization admission additionally requires a configured verified signature.
Definitions and implementation releases use same-identity/same-content
idempotency and reject replacement with different content.

The Assets **Import packages** tab provides the same three-step inspection,
permission review, install, activate, disable, and rollback workflow in desktop
and thin-client surfaces. The API routes require `asset:read` or `asset:write`;
desktop IPC exposes only typed package lifecycle channels. Package browse or
inspection never resolves or executes an implementation. Public registries,
automatic updates, package removal, and public marketplace behavior remain
unsupported.
