# Shared Asset Contracts (Foundation Slice)

## Purpose
This note captures the minimal integration seam that complements shared taxonomy with a shared asset-contract model.

## Taxonomy vs contract
- **Taxonomy** classifies what an asset is (`structuralKind`, `semanticRole`, `behaviorKind`).
- **Asset contract** describes how an asset is used (input/output surface, configurable parameters, and optional execution metadata).

These concerns remain separate and compatible.

Specialized composite semantics remain explicit in these shared contracts: workflow = orchestrator, agent = decision unit, context-bundle = input preparer.

## Shared contract model
- Inner-layer contract types live in `domain/contracts/AssetContract.ts`.
- The model is intentionally compact:
  - input shape
  - output shape
  - public parameters/config surface
  - optional execution metadata

## Resolver/projection seam
- `application/contracts/CompositionAssetContractResolver.ts` projects contracts from existing entities without requiring broad entity rewrites.
- Current grounded projections include:
  - workflows
  - agents
  - tool capabilities
  - context packages
  - context recipes
- Bounded taxonomy-driven projections cover atomic roles and all planned Direction 5 composite roles without creating a second contract system:
  - `dataset`
  - `model`
  - `config-profile`
  - `workflow`
  - `context-bundle`
  - `dataset-pipeline`
  - `training-recipe`
  - `tool-chain`
  - `app-template`
  - `system`
- Projections are intentionally taxonomy-combination aware (structural + semantic + behavior). Unsupported combinations return no projection, which keeps publish enforcement truthful and bounded.
- Canonical-entity contract resolution now includes workflow definitions plus installed/base models and execution artifacts when matching repositories/catalogs are wired.
- Direction 5 atomic studios now use this same taxonomy-driven contract seam for authoring/publish enforcement:
  - Model Studio and Dataset Studio publish with `atomic/*/none` contract projections.
  - Tool Studio publish supports `atomic/tool/(conditional|deterministic)` projections.
- Shared Studio Shell publish-time enforcement now evaluates composite drafts through the same resolver seam for taxonomy and contract consistency (no separate composite enforcement stack).
- System Studio contract projection now extends the same shared resolver seam with bounded recursive projection (`resolveSystemContract`) so system contracts truthfully reflect explicit system I/O/parameters, child bindings, and nested-system topology without creating a parallel contract model.
- System Studio now has first-class interface/config authoring operations (`updateSystemInterfaces`, `updateSystemParameters`) so explicit system inputs/outputs/parameters/default values persist through the real draft/update/validate/publish/reload path and are consumed directly by recursive contract projection.
- System Studio now also includes bounded execution metadata authoring (`updateSystemExecutionMetadata`) for runtime/environment hints, orchestration posture, publish/export metadata, execution profile metadata, and operational ownership metadata; this remains metadata-only and does not introduce a parallel runtime/deployment stack.
- Registry/system detail lineage surfaces now make system version lineage explicit with bounded nested-system/child-version reference alignment (`includedInUpstream`) so recursive system-of-systems derivation remains deterministic and grounded in canonical version/upstream truth.
- System publish enforcement now extends the same shared studio-shell enforcement seam with bounded recursive checks for system child references/contracts, binding endpoint compatibility, and recursion cycle/depth safety before publish.
- Tool Chain Studio now reuses this same composite publish-consistency seam (`tool-chain`/`deterministic`) and the shared taxonomy-driven contract projection (`executionOrdering=sequential`) for draft authoring and publish gating.
- Cross-studio end-to-end consistency coverage now verifies that projected contracts remain stable through create/update/validate/publish/reload paths over shared shell seams.

## Canonical read integration seam
- Canonical operational reads now carry optional `contract` alongside canonical identity/taxonomy/provenance/dependency metadata.
- `CanonicalEntityReadResolver` is the preferred seam for reading taxonomy + contract together where available.
- Agent Studio output/memory asset exploration now reuses canonical asset-management reads (`loadAssetDetail`, `listVersionChain`) so run/session references stay asset-native and lineage-friendly instead of introducing agent-only output APIs.

## Scope boundaries
- This is an integration foundation only.
- It does **not** add a full system-composer UI, contract editor UI, or a parallel agent-only contract universe.
- Agents continue to extend the shared composition model and use the shared contract seam.
- Direction 5 atomic studio slices now consume taxonomy-driven atomic contract projection for Prompt Template, Embedding Index, and Config Profile (`atomic/prompt-template/none`, `atomic/embedding-index/none`, `atomic/config-profile/none`) through shared shell metadata + publish-enforcement seams.

## Implementation status snapshot (Direction 5 through stories 5.24)

Fully implemented now:
- Shared taxonomy-driven contract projection for implemented atomic and composite Studio Shell roles.
- Composite publish-time consistency enforcement through shared seams (`evaluateCompositeStudioDraftConsistency` / `assertCompositeStudioDraftPublishConsistency`) across Workflow, Context Bundle, Dataset Pipeline, Training Recipe, and Tool Chain studios.
- Composite-to-atomic interop coverage through shared dependency + contract/taxonomy validation paths (no studio-specific contract stacks).

Partially implemented / bounded:
- Contract projections are baseline interaction contracts for authoring/publish-gating alignment; they are not a full runtime behavior execution contract system.

Not implemented in this slice:
- Rich visual/system-runtime contract tooling beyond current bounded System Studio panels and shared publish enforcement.

## Direction 5 update: Runtime execution contract + dependency resolution foundation (stories 6.3–6.4)

- Runtime now has an explicit execution-contract mapping seam in `application/system-runtime/RuntimeExecutionContractMapping.ts`.
- Mapping stays derived from existing shared system contract truth (`CompositionAssetContractResolver.resolveSystemContract`) plus system definitions, rather than creating a second contract universe.
- Runtime execution contract mapping now projects:
  - runtime execution inputs/outputs
  - runtime execution parameters/configuration (system-authored + contract-derived)
  - runtime-visible child component interface references for atomic/composite/system children
  - bounded recursive nested-system traversal status for system-of-systems readiness.
- Runtime now has an explicit dependency-resolution seam in `application/system-runtime/RuntimeDependencyResolution.ts`.
- Dependency resolution reuses existing version-aware recursive dependency truth (`collectSystemDirectDependencies` + nested-system traversal) and does not create a second dependency graph model.
- Recursive resolution is bounded and cycle-safe, producing deterministic runtime-oriented outputs (resolved component set, direct/transitive dependencies, ordering hints) suitable for later execution-plan construction without implementing the runtime planner/orchestrator in this slice.
