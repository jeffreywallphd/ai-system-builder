# Controlled Conversational System Execution

- Status: current
- Related decisions: `docs/adr/ADR-0023-controlled-conversational-system-execution.md`
- Verification: `docs/architecture/architecture-verification.md`

## Purpose

Controlled conversational execution defines the first runnable composed-system execution slice while preserving the existing composition-first architecture.

Architecture thesis: controlled execution orchestration can run a user-configured conversational AI system only after a reviewed execution plan, valid runtime readiness, and explicit approval. User-message turns invoke a supported text-generation runtime through a narrow runtime adapter boundary, with lifecycle, progress, safe diagnostics, assistant response results, cancellation/retry policy, and provenance recorded without making chatbot behavior the universal definition of runnable systems.

Invariant: the first conversational-system execution slice must exercise the general composed-system execution architecture. It must not make a chat page, prompt string, one local model, one API provider, or one runtime implementation the domain model for runnable systems.

## Product direction

- Users compose customized runnable systems from assets, workspace-effective customizations, composition plans, runtime readiness bindings, and execution-plan previews.
- The first executable proof is conversational (chat-style test/run), not image-generation-first.
- Conversational execution demonstrates customization, repeated interaction, session state, controlled invocation, response persistence needs, and an extensible path toward tools/retrieval/memory.
- Image generation remains a later runnable-system slice.
- ComfyUI is not the first conversational adapter unless a later image-generation decision explicitly selects it.

## Execution plan prerequisite

Controlled conversational execution depends on execution plan preparation as a stable, non-executing planning layer.

Controlled conversational execution may rely on execution plan preparation providing:

- workspace-scoped execution plan records;
- execution plan previews in Assets / Plans / Setup;
- source composition plan and runtime readiness binding references;
- planned steps/inputs/outputs/dependencies;
- safe adapter/setup references;
- safety gates, blockers, diagnostics, resource estimates, provenance;
- `ready-for-review` status that is explicitly non-executing.

If execution plan preparation has unresolved material defects, controlled conversational work should not proceed beyond architecture/docs clarification until those defects are corrected.

## Core concepts and vocabulary

- **Controlled execution orchestration**: explicit, policy-checked execution lifecycle for runnable systems.
- **Runnable conversational system**: a composed system whose supported execution behavior is turn-based text generation.
- **Conversational system definition**: safe references/configuration that define conversational behavior for a composed system.
- **Execution session**: approved execution context tied to reviewed plan/readiness inputs.
- **Conversation session**: user-visible persistent chat context for a configured composed system.
- **Conversation turn**: one user message and corresponding assistant-response generation lifecycle.
- **User message**: user input submitted for a turn.
- **Assistant response**: generated assistant output associated with the turn result.
- **Execution run**: controlled operational invocation producing one turn result.
- **Execution attempt**: one attempt within a run (supports retry/failure/cancellation tracking).
- **Execution event**: safe lifecycle/progress/audit event during orchestration.
- **Execution result**: safe recorded output reference for a run/turn.
- **Execution approval**: explicit user/system authorization boundary required before invocation.
- **Approval gate**: policy checkpoint validating approval scope validity.
- **Start eligibility**: validation that plan/readiness/approval/support constraints permit invocation.
- **Runtime invocation port**: application-facing boundary used to request supported runtime execution.
- **Text-generation runtime adapter**: adapter implementing supported text-generation invocation behind the runtime port.
- **Supported runtime adapter**: adapter explicitly approved for this execution slice.
- **Turn invocation**: run creation + invocation flow for a submitted turn.
- **Response generation**: controlled production of assistant response result.
- **Progress event**: safe state/progress signal during invocation.
- **Cancellation request**: explicit request to stop an in-flight run/attempt.
- **Retry request**: explicit request to start a new attempt under safe policy.
- **Failure classification**: normalized safe failure type with no raw provider payloads.
- **Result reference**: stable safe pointer to assistant response/result record.
- **Conversation history reference**: stable safe pointer to session turn history.
- **Safe diagnostic**: bounded redacted diagnostic data.
- **Audit/provenance event**: immutable event describing lifecycle/provenance transitions.
- **Runtime unavailable**, **runtime not ready**, **execution unsupported**, **execution blocked**, **execution stale**, **execution deferred for unsupported systems**: safe execution-state outcomes.

## System relationship

Controlled conversational execution is not a separate chatbot app. Runnable conversational execution remains downstream from composed-system architecture:

```text
assets/customizations
  -> workspace-effective assets
  -> composition plan
  -> runtime readiness binding
  -> execution plan preview
  -> approved conversation execution session
  -> controlled turn invocation
  -> assistant response/result reference
```

A conversational system may include safe configuration such as display label, instruction reference, supported text-generation capability label, generation settings, greeting, and expected IO role semantics. Final prompt/materialization boundaries must stay behind explicit contracts and protected context handling.

## Conceptual model

### Conversational System Execution Session

Conceptually includes: execution session id, conversation session id, workspace id, source execution plan id, source composition plan id, source runtime readiness binding id, supported adapter reference, status, approval status/reference, display label, conversation history reference, turn summaries, blockers, diagnostics, provenance, and timestamps.

### Conversation Turn

Conceptually includes: turn id, conversation session id, execution run id, optional attempt ids, user-message reference/content boundary, assistant-response result reference, turn status, capability reference, progress/event summary, blockers, diagnostics, and timestamps.

### Execution Run

Conceptually includes: run id, workspace id, source execution plan id, conversation session id, turn id, run status, approval reference, runtime adapter reference, attempt summaries, progress/event summaries, result references, failure/cancellation/retry info, blockers, diagnostics, provenance, and timestamps.

### Execution Attempt

Conceptually includes: attempt id, run id, attempt number, attempt status, supported adapter reference, timing/progress summary, result reference, failure classification, cancellation state, provenance, and timestamps.

### Execution Result

Conceptually includes: result id, run id, turn id, result kind (initially assistant response), safe response display reference/content boundary, optional future artifact reference, completion status, diagnostics, and timestamps.

All controlled conversational execution records avoid credentials, secrets, raw env values, raw paths, command lines, stack traces, raw provider responses, signed URLs, bytes/base64, unbounded logs, executable payloads, and generic workflow JSON.

## Conversation session vs run distinction

- Conversation session: persistent interactive context.
- Conversation turn: one user-message/assistant-response interaction.
- Execution run: controlled invocation for that turn.
- Execution attempt: one attempt to complete a run.

Default model: one conversation session has many turns; each assistant-generating turn creates one execution run with one or more attempts.

## Approval and eligibility boundary

Execution plan preparation remains preview-only and non-executing.

Initial approval flow:

1. User reviews the execution plan preview.
2. User selects **Test this system** / **Start chat**.
3. System creates a conversation execution session tied to the reviewed plan.
4. User confirms or initiates under valid runtime/setup conditions.
5. Each sent message creates a controlled turn/run invocation.

Initial policy: approval is valid for the active conversation session only while source execution plan and runtime readiness binding remain unchanged and valid. Any stale/changed inputs invalidate approval and block new invocations pending re-review.

## Initial statuses

- Conversation session: `draft`, `awaiting-approval`, `approved`, `active`, `blocked`, `stale`, `invalid`, `closed`, `archived`.
- Conversation turn: `draft`, `submitted`, `generating`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancel-requested`, `cancelled`, `retryable`, `blocked`, `stale`, `invalid`.
- Execution run: `draft`, `awaiting-approval`, `approved`, `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancel-requested`, `cancelled`, `retryable`, `blocked`, `stale`, `invalid`, `archived`.
- Attempt: `pending`, `started`, `progressing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancel-requested`, `cancelled`, `timed-out`.

`approved` permits later invocation but is not invocation. `queued` means accepted for invocation. `running` begins only when adapter execution starts. `succeeded` requires safe result reference. `cancel-requested` is not guaranteed cancellation completion. `retryable` requires safe policy. `stale` blocks invocation until revalidation.

## First supported runnable slice

The first supported slice is a conversational text-generation system with a valid execution plan, valid runtime readiness binding, safe configuration references, user text input, assistant text response result, and conversation association.

Not in the initial slice: tools, retrieval, external actions, image/audio IO, arbitrary workflow graph execution.

Unsupported plans must resolve to safe unsupported/blocked/deferred outcomes.

## Runtime adapter boundary

Use narrow invocation/cancellation/progress/result ports behind application-facing runtime seams:

- `TextGenerationInvocationPort`
- `ConversationTurnInvocationPort`
- `ExecutionCancellationPort`
- `ExecutionProgressSinkPort`
- `ExecutionResultSinkPort`

The implemented first adapter path is the Python conversational text-generation runtime adapter. Server and desktop host composition wire a conversational adapter catalog, runtime guard, and invocation port into the shared conversation execution services. The adapter supports runtime references for the Python sidecar with `text-generation` capability, invokes the Python worker `conversation-text-generation` task, and returns a bounded assistant text result through the controlled turn orchestration path.

This adapter path is a supported implementation of the first conversational slice, not a general runtime execution permission. It still requires reviewed execution-plan identity, source verification, approval validity, runtime readiness/runtime guard success, and host submit support before a turn may run. The adapter does not currently advertise progress or cancellation capability; cancel, retry, and streaming remain unsupported unless an application/runtime path genuinely supports them.

## Message/content and diagnostics boundary

- Do not persist raw provider payloads in general execution records.
- Do not expose raw runtime request/response payloads in diagnostics.
- User/assistant text exposure belongs to transcript/result surfaces, not generic operational summaries.
- User-authored instruction text should be referenced from authored assets/protected configuration, not duplicated in audit logs or generic run metadata.

## Relationship to upstream architecture

- Primary dependency: execution plan preparation.
- Eligibility verification: runtime readiness binding validity.
- Optional user-facing context: safe asset composition planning summary metadata.
- No mutation of effective asset projection, composition planning, runtime readiness, or execution plan records as an execution side effect.
- Changed composition/readiness/plan inputs stale or invalidate approval per policy.

## UI direction

In Assets / Plans / Setup: compact status/control area for preview state, readiness, conversational support, `Test this system`/`Start chat`, and blocked/review/setup messaging.

In conversational run workspace: system identity, conversation history, composer, assistant response area, generating/cancel/retry states, safe diagnostics, and explicit association to selected composed system.

Nothing runs until the user starts a conversation or sends a message.

The current Run & Test UI has incomplete correctness work around selected-system context, wording, DTO mapping, UI state, behavior tests, and final documentation. See `incomplete-work-register.md` entry IW-20260605-004.

## Transport split rule

Keep these transport responsibilities separately scoped and reviewed:

1. API/server-host exposure.
2. IPC/preload/desktop-host exposure.
3. Desktop/thin-client client wrappers and parity.

These must be routed and reviewed separately.

## Non-goals

Controlled conversational execution does not make chatbot behavior the universal runnable-system model and does not authorize workflow/image/ComfyUI execution, tools/retrieval/memory/multimodal/background/distributed execution, raw provider payload exposure, credential exposure, or mutation of upstream composition/readiness/planning records.

## Asset-first architecture

### Layer A - Reusable conversational asset family

The first runnable conversational proof starts from reusable/importable conversational assets composed from referenced `system.foundation` primitives where applicable.

### Layer B - Controlled runtime instances

Conversation sessions, turns, messages, assistant responses, execution runs, attempts, events, approvals, cancellation requests, retry requests, and results are created only when the composed system is used at runtime. These runtime records are not reusable/importable composition assets.

### Corrected pipeline

```text
system.foundation primitives
  -> reusable conversational composite assets
  -> import/customize in workspace
  -> compose a chatbot system
  -> runtime readiness binding
  -> execution plan preview
  -> approved conversation session
  -> controlled turn execution
  -> assistant response/result records
```

### No-copy semantics

- `system.foundation` definitions remain canonical.
- Reuse establishes references, dependencies, and lineage instead of copied foundation records.
- Importing/using/composing conversational starter assets must not copy foundation records into workspace-authored storage merely through use.
- Workspace-authored records are created only by deliberate customization/override behavior.
- Derived conversational assets are reusable composites and are not reclassified as primitive defaults unless built-in pack metadata explicitly preserves derived lineage.

Runtime records are operational records only and are never reusable asset substitutes.

## Boundary repair status

- Session/source summaries derive reusable/customized conversational-system claims from structured verified source evidence. A composition-plan id, label, summary, runtime capability string, or renderer/browser-provided text is not proof of conversational origin.
- Conversation session creation accepts reviewed execution-plan identity and workspace scope only. Display/source identity is derived from verified source records rather than caller-provided `systemLabel` or `systemSummary` claims.
- Session read models project submission/action availability from current application eligibility: session status, approval validity, source validity, runtime-readiness/runtime-reference state, host submit support, and active-turn constraints. Provenance text alone is not execution readiness.
- Transcript reads and completed submit results are the deliberate visible-content surfaces. Session summaries, action availability, activity, approval/cancel/retry, diagnostics, and errors remain operational and must not copy full transcript text or protected runtime/provider context.
- API, IPC, preload, desktop-client, and thin-client surfaces use typed safe DTOs for conversational operations. Cancel and retry remain unsupported/deferred unless application behavior can actually perform them. Streaming remains deferred.
- Real server and desktop hosts compose the conversational service family. Both expose session/read/approval boundaries; turn submission is wired only through the controlled application/orchestration/runtime-adapter path and must still pass approval/source/readiness/runtime guards. No production fake response generator is allowed.
