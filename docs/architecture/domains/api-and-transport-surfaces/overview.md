# API and Transport Surfaces Domain Overview

## Purpose

Define the architecture boundary for api-and-transport-surfaces and route domain-scoped architecture knowledge into predictable overview and reference documents.

## Boundary

- Owns architecture contracts scoped to the api-and-transport-surfaces taxonomy boundary.
- Links to adjacent domains for cross-boundary behavior instead of duplicating authority.

## What Belongs in the Overview

- Domain boundary intent, ownership seams, and cross-domain dependency rules.
- Domain-wide invariants that shape multiple reference contracts.
- Concise routing links to the canonical reference documents in `./references/`.

## What Does Not Belong in the Overview

- Endpoint-level schemas, API payload matrices, and low-level interface catalogs.
- Step-by-step operational runbooks and troubleshooting procedures.
- Contributor process checklists, implementation task plans, or release notes.
