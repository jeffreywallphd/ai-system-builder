# Desktop App

> AI documentation reminder: when behavior in this area changes, update the related ADRs, architecture docs, context packs, and README files in the same change.

## Toolchain

- Host runtime: Electron
- Build/dev system: Electron Forge (webpack plugin)
- Entry point orchestration: `apps/desktop/src/main` + `modules/hosts/desktop`

## Commands

From the repository root:

- `npm run dev:desktop`
- `npm run package`
- `npm run make`

## Preload Bridge Surface

The preload layer exposes a narrow desktop API at `window.desktopApi` for UI-to-host transport.

Current methods:

- `uploadArtifact(input, context?)`
  - maps UI-provided upload payload into the `artifact.upload` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.upload.request`
  - returns the structured IPC upload response envelope
- `browseArtifacts(context?)`
- `readArtifactDetail(locator, context?)`
- `readArtifactContentDescriptor(locator, context?)`
- `readArtifactViewerMedia(locator, context?)`
- `publishArtifactToRepo(input, context?)`
  - maps UI publish payload into the `artifact.publish` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.publish.request`
  - returns structured publish result/failure envelope
- `verifyPublishedArtifactBacking(input, context?)`
  - maps UI verification payload into the `artifact.publish.verify` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.publish.verify.request`
  - returns structured verify result/failure envelope
- `verifyImportedArtifactSourceBacking(input, context?)`
  - maps UI imported-source verification payload into the `artifact.source.verify` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.source.verify.request`
  - returns structured source-verify result/failure envelope
- `registerArtifactFromRepo(input, context?)`
  - maps UI register payload into the `artifact.register.from-repo` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.register.from-repo.request`
  - returns structured register result/failure envelope
- `localizeArtifactFromRepo(input, context?)`
  - maps UI localize payload into the `artifact.localize.from-repo` IPC request envelope
  - invokes only `ipc.artifact.localize.from-repo.request`
  - returns structured localize result/failure envelope
- `ingestWebsitePage(input, context?)`
  - maps UI website-scrape payload into the `artifact.ingest-website-page` IPC request envelope
  - forwards explicit `context.workspaceId` to the desktop host use case for workspace-scoped artifact catalog writes
- `ingestWebsitePagesBatch(input, context?)`
  - maps UI batch website-scrape payload into the `artifact.ingest-website-pages-batch` IPC request envelope
  - forwards explicit `context.workspaceId` to the desktop host use case for workspace-scoped artifact catalog writes

Design constraints:

- preload remains transport-oriented (no business/use-case logic)
- UI callers do not access IPC primitives or filesystem details directly

## Renderer Upload Component

`src/renderer/App.tsx` provides an Artifacts workflow with upload + artifact browser + publish:

- selects one or more files from a native file input using the accepted artifact upload policy
- reads file bytes in the renderer (`File.arrayBuffer()` -> `Uint8Array`)
- calls preload bridge methods (`window.desktopApi.*`) through feature-local clients/hooks
- uploads selected files as independent artifact-upload requests so one rejected file does not stop the rest of the batch
- reports a per-file result list, keeps successful stored keys visible, and lets users cancel queued files before or during a batch
- renders browse/detail/content preview and Hugging Face publish success/error feedback
- supports published-backing re-check and last-verified display from durable binding metadata
- supports imported-source re-check and separate source verification status display
- supports imported-source inspection and explicit localize/download action when local bytes are missing
- supports website scraping through desktop preload/IPC with active workspace context
- opens the Data Management Hugging Face import card directly to namespace browsing and repository/path registration controls
- surfaces artifact-first backing-state cues (`Remote only`, `Localized`, `Published`) plus local object availability/localization state
- exposes Dataset Preparation training-task profiles from shared runtime contracts and submits executable first-tier dataset-preparation profiles to the local runtime, including LLM text rows and diffusion/vision image manifest rows
- lets Dataset Preparation choose provided source text or generated text fields in the Automated Data Formatting card, with editable prompts, task-scoped generation parameters, quality/compact local model presets, and an inline model download action that still records downloads through model management
- filters Dataset Preparation source artifacts by selected task family and lets users save/load changed training settings without preserving stale source-artifact selections
- exposes the selected training task in Train Model requests; LLM text tasks run through causal-LM training, diffusion image-caption manifests run through LoRA adapter training, and vision manifests run through LoRA adapter or full-finetune classification, detection, or segmentation training
- reuses shared cross-host publish/re-check hook logic from `modules/ui/shared`

Renderer constraints for this slice:

- no direct filesystem access from UI
- no direct IPC channel usage from UI
- no styling expansion beyond the existing minimal renderer structure

## Renderer Shell And Workspace UI

- Desktop primary navigation is exposed through a plain hamburger menu in the right side of the header, directly before the themed settings gear.
- The header centers a compact **Current Workspace** selector with an explicit **Change** action between the brand area and the right-side menu/settings actions.
- The Home page keeps the fuller workspace card in a compact responsive equal-width two-column layout, with change-workspace controls on the left and create-workspace controls on the right.
- Workspace-required pages should rely on the header for current workspace display and should not repeat current workspace labels in each feature panel.
- Data Management tab content uses the shared sectioned panel header style for Data Artifact Ingester, Artifact Browser, and Dataset Preparation; panel headers stay title-only, body content uses grouped sections and card/list controls, and actions such as Artifact Browser refresh belong in the body.
- Artifact Browser and Dataset Preparation source lists classify uploaded/generated artifacts by storage path segments and `sourceKind`, so workspace-prefixed keys such as `workspaces/.../artifacts/files/uploads/...` still appear in the uploaded group.

## Hugging Face auth behavior

- Desktop renderer Hugging Face register/localize/publish/verify flows go through desktop preload + desktop host composition.
- Configure `HF_TOKEN` or `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN` (or desktop host `huggingFaceAccessToken`) in the **desktop host** environment for private/gated Hugging Face repositories.
- Public repositories may work without a token depending on repository visibility/provider policy.
- Missing/invalid token and access-denied responses are surfaced with explicit auth guidance in UI messaging.


## Hugging Face token configuration UI

- Desktop Artifact Browser now includes a **Hugging Face token** section with masked configured-state display.
- Use **Save token** / **Clear token** in renderer; desktop host persists the token and reuses it for register/localize/publish/verify flows.
- Public Hugging Face repos may work without token; private/gated repos may require token configuration.
