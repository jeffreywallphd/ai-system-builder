# Installing the implementation-roadmap skill

The canonical skill lives at
`skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps/SKILL.md` and follows the open Agent Skills
format. Keep one canonical copy in this repository. Let installers place or adapt it
for each supported host rather than maintaining divergent Codex, Claude, Copilot, or
Gemini copies.

## GitHub CLI skill commands

GitHub CLI 2.90 or later includes public-preview `gh skill` commands. Preview the
repository's discoverable skills:

```text
gh skill list <owner>/<repository>
gh skill preview <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps
```

Install for a host and scope:

```text
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent codex --scope user
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent claude-code --scope user
gh skill install <owner>/<repository> manage-implementation-roadmaps --agent github-copilot --scope user
```

Install from a trusted local checkout while developing:

```text
gh skill install . manage-implementation-roadmaps --from-local --agent codex --scope project
```

Choose `--scope project` when collaborators should use the skill only in the
current project. Choose `--scope user` when the same user should invoke it in other
repositories. Review the skill and every bundled script before installation,
especially when the source is not this repository.

The current `gh skill` agent catalog includes Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot,
Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other hosts. Run `gh skill install --help` for
the locally installed version's exact values because the feature remains in preview.

## Codex installer

Codex users can also ask the built-in installer to install the published GitHub
directory:

```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>/tree/<ref>/skills/manage-implementation-roadmaps
```

Restart or reopen the agent session when the host requires skill rediscovery.

## Host-native locations

When an automatic installer is unavailable, use the host's documented project or
user skill directory. Examples include:

- Claude Code project skills: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`;
- GitHub Copilot repository skills: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`;
- Agent Skills-compatible shared project discovery:
  `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

Prefer installation or a generated adapter over copying. If a copy is unavoidable,
record its canonical source and version and add an automated parity check.

## Publishing checks

Before publishing or changing the skill:

1. Run the skill unit tests.
2. Run the repository documentation and agent-support gates.
3. Run the skill validator supplied by the creating host.
4. Preview installation from the repository or a temporary package.
5. Scan the skill tree for credentials, personal names, absolute local paths, and
   private conversation text.
6. Test natural-language triggering with requests that do and do not name the skill.
7. Confirm the installed host can locate references and scripts relative to
   `SKILL.md`.
