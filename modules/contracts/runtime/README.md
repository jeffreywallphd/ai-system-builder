# Runtime Contracts

Shared runtime execution contracts live in this module.

The contract family is intentionally thin and adapter-oriented:

- runtime target identity (`runtime-kind`, `runtime-target`)
- execution request contract (`runtime-execution-request`)
- execution result + failure contracts (`runtime-execution-result`, `runtime-execution-error`)
- optional progress/output event stream shape (`runtime-execution-event`)
- runtime diagnostics aligned to logging vocabulary (`runtime-execution-diagnostic`)

These contracts support the TypeScript-first model while leaving runtime protocol details evolvable for adapter implementations.

Dataset preparation contracts include a shared task-profile vocabulary for first-tier training dataset shapes:
LLM instruction tuning, classification, extraction, embedding tuning, reranking, diffusion LoRA, vision classification,
vision detection, and vision segmentation. The Python dataset-preparation worker supports these profiles as dataset
artifact outputs: LLM profiles can emit generated or structured text rows, diffusion/vision profiles emit image
manifest rows from source metadata or structured manifest files. Model-training execution remains a separate runtime
task boundary and must not be inferred from dataset-preparation profile support.

Text-bearing dataset-preparation recipes use `task.textInputMode` to choose provided source text versus generated text,
and `generation.promptTemplate` carries the editable system prompt for generated labels, captions, questions, answers,
or extracted fields. Built-in model presets stay within the 7B limit: quality uses `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`, while
compact uses `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`. Task-scoped generation parameter defaults also live here so UI and runtime
request builders do not drift into separate QA-generation, model-override, or duplicated-parameter systems.

Model-training task requests may carry `trainingTask` so runtime adapters can validate task support and annotate
generated model outputs. The current Python trainer supports the LLM text task profiles through causal-LM training,
diffusion LoRA through Diffusers adapter training, and vision classification/detection/segmentation through
task-specific Transformers vision LoRA or full fine-tuning. Image-manifest model training receives runtime-local
source file paths through dataset metadata; runtime workers must not reach back into artifact storage directly.
