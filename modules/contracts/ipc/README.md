# IPC Contracts

IPC contracts specialize the shared transport contract core for desktop host
message boundaries.

This family keeps the contract surface thin:

- channel naming/value shapes (`ipc-channel`)
- operation and metadata aliases from transport core (`ipc-operation`)
- channel-bound IPC request/error/response factories that preserve transport-core semantics

These contracts are intentionally serialization-friendly and avoid preload,
registration, or `ipcMain`/`ipcRenderer` mechanics. Those details belong in
adapter implementations, not in shared contracts.

IPC channel semantics are intentionally narrow:

- channel values are derived from operation identity using `ipc.<operation>.<kind>`
- channel kind is constrained to `request`, `response`, or `event`
- channel bindings pair `operation` with derived channel value and explicit kind
- request/error/response factories take that binding so operation identity is not passed independently
- success/failure result semantics are composed from `modules/contracts/transport`
