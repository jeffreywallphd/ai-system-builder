# Host Context Contracts

Shared host context contracts for passing host metadata across boundaries without
leaking framework objects.

Current scope is intentionally small:

- host kind vocabulary (`host-kind`)
- host identity shape (`host-identity`)
- host context envelope for boundary metadata (`host-context`)

These contracts must stay host-agnostic and serialization-friendly.

Do not add Electron window objects, HTTP request objects, or session/auth models
to this contract family.
